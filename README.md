# Sales Insight Dashboard
### Dashboards for sales for a multinational manufacturing company.
# Situation
I have sales data from 2010 to 2014 for a product-based company, and I need to determine the company's year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and month-over-month sales increment, fluctuation, and growth.
# Task
I downloaded sales data from GitHub; the data was in JSON format, but I needed to convert it to table format by removing inconsistencies and redundant elements and converting it to information form which will consider for performance analysis and is used by operation managers and teams
monitor revenues, expenses, and profitability across the organization.

# Action
* Assuring that the requirements are specified in a way that is understandable, unambiguous, and capable of being implemented and tested for the intended audience.
* After converting that JSON file into table form, there are more than 60000 rows of data, with redundancy, insistency columns and rows, and errors (ex. #null, #num!/0, #N/A, #####, and so on) removed which willÂ a completely accurate and quick dashboard formed.
* Implement authorization and authentication to ensure that the correct person receives the correct information.
* Optimize MS Excel for maximum performance. Provide support for both upcoming enhancements and the existing application.

# Result
Convert 60000+ data points for performance monitoring, which will be utilized by operation teams and managers to monitor revenues, expenses, and profitability across the organization.
